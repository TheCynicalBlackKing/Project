			<h1> Cartoon </h1>

				<p> The show concerned the war between two factions of sentient robots - the heroic Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, and the evil Decepticons, led by Megtron. In the three-part opening, the Autobots fled their home planet of Cybertron after the war drained much of its energy. The Decepticons and followed, and after a short space battle, they crash landed on Earth where they lay dormant for four million years. When they were revived, the Transformers took on the appearance of Earth vehicles as a form of disguise. The Decepticons immediately set out to steal all of Earth's energy, and the Autobots tried to stop them. Most episodes involved the Decepticons either coming up with a new evil scheme to steal Earth's energy, or to the destroy the Autobots forever. </p>

			<h3> Season One </h3>

				<p> The first season primarily took place on Earth, with a few excursions to Cybertron. It started with the 1984 toys as its characters (with some exceptions), and introduced the early wave of 1985 toys as it progressed - the Constructicons, Dinobots, Insecticons, and Skyfire. </p>

				<p> The first three episodes were promoted as a miniseries, airing across three consecutive weekdays. A proper 13-episode season then began broadcasting on a weekly basis, usually on Saturday mornings, the following month. </p>

    				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wSRX_DwfKIE?showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

			<h3> Season Two </h3>

				<p> At 49 episodes, the second season of The Transformers was rather substantial in length. The seemingly random number of 49 was not quite so random, though, as 65 episodes are the minimum requirement for a cartoon series to qualify for syndication status.  In addition to these 49 episodes, a series of 5 public service announcements were animated, presumably to accompany the episodes. For whatever reason, these PSAs were never broadcast and the episodes aired without the burden of trying to teach you anything.</p>

				<p> The second season greatly expanded the cartoon's scope and cast. This season tends to feature more character-driven episodes than the first, with many characters getting their own "spotlight" episode. It also features a recurring theme of the Autobots assimilating Earth culture, such as playing basketball and football and even watching a soap opera. Excursions to alien civilizations popped up occasionally as well (not to mention time travel, miniaturization, and battles against undersea creatures). The second season also saw the introduction of concepts and characters that would spread out to other segments of the franchise, including the mystic Alpha Trion, the ancient Vector Sigma supercomputer and its circuit key, not to mention the first appearance of Female Transformers within official fiction. </p>

				<p> This season also marked a move from weekly airings (usually on Saturday mornings) to syndicated weekday broadcasts, airing Monday through Friday, either in the morning or afternoon. Some markets also scheduled it in conjunction with daily episodes of G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (like WPIX in New York). </p>

			<h3> The Transformers Movie </h3>

				<p> The Transformers: The Movie is in continuity with the cartoon series, occurring 20 years after the end of Season 2 (in the then-futuristic year of 2005). It was the single biggest turning point for the series, and remains controversial. The movie saw the introductions of Unicron, the Quintessons, and the Matrix of Leadership, all of which would play important roles in Season 3. It made radical changes to the show's cast, killing off many characters and introducing new onesâ€”a shock to young viewers who were used to their heroes driving off into the sunset at the end of every adventure. </p>

				<p> Despite its unconventional place in the cartoon canon, it remains the best-known representation of the cartoon series among fans. </p>

			<h3> Season Three </h3>

				<p> Season 3 transformed the whole premise of the show. Gone were the two teams stranded on Earth, along with many of the characters that composed those teams. In their place was a galaxy-spanning tale of battles on alien worlds. With the Autobots in firm control of Cybertron, the Decepticons, though still a threat, were somewhat reduced as villains; new enemies in the form of the Quintessons were introduced. Plots often centered on the ultra-powerful city-bots, Metroplex and Trypticon. </p>

				<p> Season 3 has a mixed reputation. It contains some of the most mistake-laden episodes of the entire franchise ("Five Faces of Darkness", "Carnage in C Minor", the title sequence at right) most of which can be laid at the feet of AKOM. But some of its episodes are among the best as well, both in animation and scripting; "Dark Awakening", "Chaos", "Webworld", and "Dweller in the Depths" are all heavy fan favorites. </p>

				<p> Late in Season 3, as in Season 2, the forerunners of the 1987 toy line were introduced: the Terrorcons, Technobots, and Throttlebots, and (very briefly) the cassettes Slugfest and Overkill. The season concluded with the resurrection of Optimus Prime, spurred on by a massive campaign on the part of fans, who were displeased by his death and subsequent "evil" resurrection. </p>

			<h3> Season Four </h3>

				<p> According to David Wise, he was contacted by Sunbow Productions to write a five-part series finale which would introduce a deluge of new characters while simultaneously tying up the series. Shortly after Wise completed the five-episode outline, however, a budget cutback reduced it to a three-parter. This created a massive headache for the writer, who did the math and claimed that they'd be introducing a new character just about every 28 or 90 seconds. Dan Gilvezan also expressed his confusion at the truncated season, as 98 episodes didn't fit into a syndicated weekday broadcast schedule (which needed to be divisible by 5). </p>

				<p> In the end, 25 brand new Transformers and 21 Nebulans, that's 46 new characters in all, were introduced across these final three episodes. Well, that's assuming you count Fortress Maximus and Scorponok as separate characters from Cerebros and Zarak... and Punch and Counterpunch as one guy. </p>

				<p> While the previous three seasons each featured fully original title sequences, season 4's title sequence was more economically cobbled together. By combining animation taken from toy commercials (produced by Toei) and animation from the season 3 title sequence (produced by AKOM), they crafted a "new" title sequence (which used the season 3 rendition of the theme song). A clever ploy, though the difference in animation quality and art style between segments produced by Toei and AKOM leads to the footage blending rather poorly. </p>

			<h3> Season Five: </h3>

				<p> Season 5 did not feature any new episodes, but rather consisted of 15 episodes from the previous seasons and The Transformers: The Movie broken up into five episodes, for a total of 20 episodes. A music video for "The Touch" was also used to fill time. </p>

				<p> In addition to a new title sequence and new commercial bumpers, new bookending segments were added to each episode. These segments featured an animatronic/stop-motion puppet of Powermaster Optimus Prime meeting regularly with a live-action human named Tommy Kennedy to tell him old Transformers stories. While the stories were old, the bookending segments took place in a contemporary time with Optimus regularly name dropping characters who never appeared in the older episodes, but were currently available on store shelves. </p>

				<p> Production of the segments fell under Tim Speidel, a producer for Griffin Bacal (the New York-based advertising company which co-developed The Transformers). The Optimus Prime puppet was operated by Marty Robinson, a famous puppeteer best known for his work on Sesame Street. Filming of these segments was completed in one week during June, 1988, at Silver Cup Studios in Queens, New York. Powermaster Optimus Prime was made of wood and very fragile in certain areas, requiring actor Jason Jansen to watch his step while filming. Apparently, at one point a camera rig fell over onto the wooden Optimus Prime hand right where Jansen would have been sitting if he hadn't been eating a bagel at the craft services table. A crane operator who was strapped to the camera wasn't so fortunate and "rode" the falling equipment down for 40 feet. </p>
