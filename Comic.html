						<!--Description About The Original Transformers Comic Series-->
						<p> The first few comics were produced by Marvel Comics, and it is sometimes stated that the comic predates the cartoon, and although the first issue of the comic came out before the first episode of the cartoon, the cartoon itself went into production long before the comic. </p>

						<p> The comic was initially set in the main Marvel Universe, but soon moved to a seperate Alternate Universe along with the G.I. Joe comic to prevent Executive Meddling from Hasbro interfering with Marvel's own character. It was originally written by Bob Budiansky: he and hos successor, Simon Furman, would end up having more influence on the overall Transformers mythos than anyone else. During this time, instead of simply telling the artists what to draw, the writers simply gave them a plot outline and let them draw a strip. Budiansky and Furman then took the strip and added Speech Bubble; this arrangmement meant that the artists had much more influence on the story than what is common nowadays. </p>

						<p> In America, the comic was first published as a bimonthly miniseries, before being developing into an ongoing monthly title. It was printed on higher-quality paper than most other comics, and as a result was also more expensive. While it used the same characters, setting, and premise as the cartoon, it told a significantly different set of stories. In particular, while the Transformers in the cartoon were built by Quintessons, in the comic, they were created by the god Primus, a part of canon later cartoon series adopted. </p>
					
						<p> In the UK, the comic was published weekly for most of its run, and the American comics were commonly split in two in order to stretch the material. These were interspersed with original stories, mostly written by Simon Furman, which were where concepts like Primus which later migrated to the US title made their first appearance. These stories usually fit in with the American continuity, albeit with occasional twisting. After Budiansky suffered Creator Breakdown as a result of trying to keep Hasbro happy, Furman was brought on to write both the US and UK comics. His focus on story arcs and Character Development was considered the high point of the comic's run; however, due to a communications breakdown, the UK comics at this point drifted out of sync with the US publication. They also stopped doing full length original stories and began printing even less American material in each issue, splitting the original issues into three or four parts. To make up for the dramatically shortened length, the UK comic also featured a secondary, backup strip in black and white, written by Furman. </p>

						<p> It finally ended after 80 issues (in America) or 332 (in Britain) due to declining interest in Transformers, though Marvel would later publish the short-lived Generation 2 comic. In 2012, IDW Publishing announced Transformers: Regeneration One, a relaunch of the Marvel Transformers continuity picking up 21 years after where issue 80 left off. This series ran for 22 issues (including #80.5, given away for Free Comic Book Day 2012, and issue #0, set between #94 and #95), concluding definitively with issue #100 in March 2014. </p>

									<p style = "line-height: 0.8; font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;"> Regeneration One Cover from IGN.com CC-BY </p> <!--Credit For Toy Picture-->

										<p> An IDW Transformers series that that takes place 21 years after the conclusion of the Transformers Issue 80 (the final issue in the original Transformers G1 comic series), with a newly restored Cybertron falling under attack by Soundwave and other surviving Decepticons. The series served as a self-contained sequel, not acknowledging the developments in Marvel's Generation 2 comics. </p> <!--Short Description About Transformers Regeneration One-->

									<p style = "line-height: 0.8; font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;"> War Within Cover from IGN.com CC-BY </p> <!--Credit For Toy Picture-->
	
										<p> The War Within explores the political turmoil on ancient Cybertron and Optimus Prime's rise from humble origins to become a noble leader. The series offered a much more in-depth and fascinating look at Transformers icons in this era. And the series also served as writer Simon Furman's big return to the Transformers franchise after his Marvel work ended. </p> <!--Description About Transformers War Within-->

									<p style = "line-height: 0.8; font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;"> All Hail Megatron Cover from IGN.com CC-BY </p> <!--Credit For Toy Picture-->

										<p> All Hail Megatron is a 16-issue maxi-series that served as a sort of soft reboot of IDW's Transformers publishing line. After several years of rotating mini-series and various spinoffs and character spotlights, the publisher really needed to give readers a proper jumping-on point. That's what writer Shane McCarthy managed with this storyline. Picking up from the events of Transformers: Devastation, the Autobots are left scattered and broken on Cybertron, while Megatron and his Decepticons rule Earth with a literal iron fist. </p> <!--Short Description About All Hail Megatron-->

								
								<li> The Matrix Quest </li> <!--Fourth Item: The Matrix Quest-->

									<img src = "The Matrix Quest.jpg"/> <!--Cover Art For The Matrix Quest-->
									
									<p style = "line-height: 0.8; font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;"> The Matrix Quest Cover from IGN.com CC-BY </p> <!--Credit For Toy Picture-->

										<p> This storyline unfolded across issues #62-66, with Optimus Prime dispatching several teams of Autobots across the galaxy to track down the Matrix of Leadership and hopefully put a halt to Unicron's warpath. The structure of "The Matrix Quest" is interesting in that each issue offers a fairly standalone tale that contributes to the overall narrative. More interesting is how each issue pays homage to a famous novel or film. Transformers #62 echoes The Maltese Falcon, issue #63 references several Wild West films, Issue #64 is a clear homage to Moby Dick, and issue #65 draws inspiration from Alien and Aliens. </p> <!--Short Description About The Matrix Quest-->

								
								<li> Last Stand of the Wreckers </li> <!--Fifth Item: Last Stand Of The Wreckers-->
	
	
									<img src = "Last Stand Of The Wreckers.jpg"/> <!--Cover Art For Last Stand Of The Wreckers-->
									
									<p style = "line-height: 0.8; font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;"> The Last Stand Of The Wreckers Cover from IGN.com CC-BY </p> <!--Credit For Toy Picture-->

										<p> The premise of this series is pretty straightforward. The Autobots' resident black-ops crew, the Wreckers, are reassembled in the aftermath of All Hail Megatron. They're dispatched to a remote prison facility that has been out of communication with both Autobots and Decepticons for years. And what they find there isn't pleasant. Last Stand of the Wreckers is a dark, emotional, often brutal series, where our heroes die painfully and often. One of Roche and Roberts' themes in the story is the way heroes can die pointless deaths. That approach allows readers to feel for and identity with the cast in ways that are usually difficult with Transformers stories. No longer are these bots larger than life figures. </p> <!--Short Description About Last Stand Of The Wreckers-->
